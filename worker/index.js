/**
 * Custom service worker source for next-pwa's "custom worker" build
 * (https://github.com/shadowwalker/next-pwa#custom-worker). When a file
 * exists at `worker/index.js` (this file), next-pwa compiles it with
 * webpack (target: webworker) into its own chunk and automatically
 * `importScripts`s it into the generated `public/sw.js`, ahead of
 * Workbox's own precaching/routing setup — no next.config.js changes are
 * needed beyond having next-pwa configured, which this project already
 * does (see next.config.js's `withPWA`).
 *
 * This is the always-loaded home for:
 *  - the player-onboarding-wizard background sync (issue #1181): finishing
 *    a *signed* registration transaction's broadcast to Soroban RPC even
 *    after the tab — or the whole installed PWA — has been closed, and
 *  - the pre-existing generic offline-queue sync relay, wired in here via
 *    importScripts since public/sw-offline-queue.js was previously never
 *    reachable by the generated service worker at all (see that file's
 *    header comment, updated alongside this change).
 *
 * Note on why a *signed* transaction is what gets queued, not the raw form
 * data: registration is a Soroban smart-contract call, and signing it
 * happens locally via the player's wallet extension (Freighter, etc.) —
 * that step needs no network and cannot happen without the private key, so
 * it cannot run from a service worker. What *does* fail on a flaky mobile
 * connection is the network round-trip that follows signing: broadcasting
 * the already-signed envelope to the RPC node. That's the part a signed,
 * base64 XDR string is sufficient to retry — no key material required —
 * which is exactly what background sync is good for.
